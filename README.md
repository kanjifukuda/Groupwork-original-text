POSシステムの説明
Background 
Point-of-sale (POS) systems are critical components in any retail environment. 
Having evolved beyond simple cash registers, a modern POS system is tied to a business’s payment processing, inventory, and customer relationship management (CRM) functions. 
Innovations in POS software development have also made it easier for small and mid-sized businesses to deploy feature-rich POS tools in their retail environments. 
To support these increased requirements, POS system developers are using common development environments such as Microsoft Windows. 
There are estimates that as many as 76% of POS systems are running some version of Microsoft Windows. 
POS systems have also been a popular target for criminals due to their role in processing financial transactions. 
Small businesses that do not have dedicated information security resources to help secure their retail environments are at increased risk. 
These businesses may lack robust protection mechanisms to ensure the security of their POS devices. 
In addition, small businesses typically have limited resources and rely on the computers hosting the POS system to provide other functions, including email and web browsing. 
Businesses that handle payment card data have to conform to Payment Card Industry (PCI) regulations to ensure the security of card holder data. 
However, the obligation to safeguard customer data extends beyond regulatory compliance, as mer- chants responsible for card data theft can be subject to fines, culpability for financial losses, loss of customer confidence, and negative impact to their brand. 
Reasons Increased POS vendor diversity POS systems have become readily available to small and mid-sized businesses to deploy without relying on a third-party integrator or value-added reseller (VAR) that specializes in implementing POS solutions for retail environments. 
This accessibility provides an increased landscape of POS devices using com- mercially available operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, which are already viable platforms for malware. 
In addition, these POS devices may be set up in insecure environments that are not PCI compliant or are at increased risk even if compliance is met. 
Criminal market demand 
The criminal underground operates very much like a legitimate economy. 
There are demands for goods and services that allow opportunities for vendors to provide products to meet that demand. 
The increased demand for stolen pre- paid credit cards has likely contributed to the increased demand for malware targeting POS systems.
